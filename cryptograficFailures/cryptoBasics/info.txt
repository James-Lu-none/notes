Basic authentication is sometimes used by web applications.
This uses base64 encoding. Therefore, it is important to at
least use Transport Layer Security (TLS or more commonly known as https)
to protect others from reading the username password that is sent to the server.

Symmetric encryption: use same key
Asymmetric encryption: use key pair (public/private)

HTTPS uses both symmetric and asymmetric keys
Here is a short description of what happens if you open your browser and go to an https site.

1. Your browser connects to the server and gets the webserver certificate

2. Your browser checks if it trusts the certificate issuer by checking if the issuer certificate is in its trust store.
This trust store is managed by operating system and browser updates. And on some corporate networks it is managed by the company.
From the certificate the browser obtains the public key.

3. The browser now generates random bytes to be used to generate a symmetric key and encrypts this with the public key of the server.
 So only the server can decrypt it.

At the end of this process both the browser and the webserver will use the exchanged symmetric key (in the asymmetric key exchange process)
 to encrypt and decrypt messages that are sent back and forth between the browser and the webserver.

*Signature
The signature can be supplied separately from the data that it validates, or in the case of CMS or SOAP can be included in the same file.

Party-A "signs" the data by "calculating the hash of the data" and encrypting that hash using an asymmetric private key
Party-B can then verify the data by calculating the hash of the data and decrypting the signature  to compare if both hashes are the same. (using public key)
