# Linux Daemons

## what are Daemons

linux daemons are background processes, aka "services", like networking, printing, SSH

and we can find all the processes using

```bash
sudo ps -aux
#or futher using grep to find the specific one
sudo ps -aux | grep [service_id]
```

and most of them are **daemons** or **units**, we can identify them easily by checking if its id is ended with "d"
ex:root         856  0.0  0.0  15412  8744 ?        Ss   21:05   0:00 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups

## how to control Daemons

we can use the most used daemon master "systemD" (which stands for system daemon), who has two main jobs: service managing and initialization system.
when we boot the system, linux kernel will start and execute it in the first place, so it has process id(PID) #1
