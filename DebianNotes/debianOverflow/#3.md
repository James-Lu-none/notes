# XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set

XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is an environment variable used in Unix-like operating systems to define the path to a directory where user-specific non-essential runtime files and other session data should be stored. This directory is typically used for communication and coordination between processes within the user's session.

and to solve "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set", we can add

```bash
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
```

in the ~/.bashrc
