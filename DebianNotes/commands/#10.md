# Logs

logs stay in the /var dir in Unix Filesyetem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) since it contains data that changes frequently while the system is running

```bash
cat /var/log/foo.log #print all log
tail /var/log/foo/log #print last 10 lines of log
tail -f /var/log/foo.log #print log in real time
```
