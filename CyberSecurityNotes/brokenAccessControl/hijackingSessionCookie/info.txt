-Session Hijacking

session IDs that are not complex and random enough and get session-based brute force attacks,
giving out authenticated session to hackers

we can use the Sequence in burp suite to get a series of hijack_cookie and then sort the tokens
and try to inspect it.
By inspecting it, we can see the numbers before the dash is sequence and the after is epoch time
and we can see that there is some sequencial numbers missing between, which is the numbers that is used by others
so we can brute force the numbers and the epoch time in between
ex:
mine: ...75-t1
mine: ...76-t2
mine: ...78-t4

in this case, the session cookie with sequence number = ...77 with epoch time between t1 and t2 might be using for someone else
