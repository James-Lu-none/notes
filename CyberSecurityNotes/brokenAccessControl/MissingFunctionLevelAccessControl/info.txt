-Access control
ex: XSS(cross site scripting), can be resolved by output encoding, which 
transform data into a safe formate that does not interfere with the intended functionality or
appearance of the web page

IDOR vs missing function level access control
IDOR: mostly horizontal or lateral access control issue
MFLAC: exposes functionality

-Relying on obscurity
One could rely on HTML, CSS, or javascript
to hide links that users donâ€™t normally access.
In the past, a network router tried to protect (hide) admin functionality with javascript in the UI

-DOM (document object model)
connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document
,simply says, it represents tje content of xml or html document as tree structure
(html/xml is more like a string and DOM is the parser)
is a programming interface, can be written in javaScript
