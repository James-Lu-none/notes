```
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/_ping": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

- Check Docker Group Membership: Ensure that the user you are using to connect to Docker is a member of the docker group. Users in the docker group typically have permission to connect to the Docker daemon.
`sudo usermod -aG docker your_username`
- Restart Docker Service: After adding your user to the docker group, restart the Docker service to apply the changes.
`sudo service docker restart`
- Verify Docker Socket Permissions: Check the permissions of the Docker socket file /var/run/docker.sock. It should be owned by the docker group and have read/write/execute permissions for the group.You can check the permissions using the 
`ls -l /var/run/docker.sock`
If the permissions are incorrect, you can adjust them using:
`sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`
