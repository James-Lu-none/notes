# Failed to create pod sandbox: open /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf: no such file or directory

install systemd-resolved

```bash
sudo apt install systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
```

and check **/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf**, there should be

```bash
nameserver [ip]
```

where ip should be the router gateway.
