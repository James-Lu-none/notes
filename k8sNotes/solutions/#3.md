# nodes not ready

from the output of the kubeadm init command:

```
You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
```

which means that pod network wont be installed with kubeadm init command and requires one to manually install the addons to configure the Networking and Network Policy.
