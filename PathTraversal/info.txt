-Path traversal (dot-dot-slash attack)
A path(directory) traversal is a vulnerability where an attacker can access or store files and directories outside the application’s location, by using "../" to walk up the to the root directories.
root/A/B/../ -> root/A/

../test
..'../'/test

-Zip Slip vulnerability
path traversal can be used while extracting files. You might be able to overwrite the ls command while extracting a zip file.

for a java zipping code like this:
File destinationDir = new File("/tmp/zip");
Enumeration<? extends ZipEntry> entries = zip.entries();
while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  InputStream is = zip.getInputStream(e);
  IOUtils.copy(is, write(f));
}

it is vulnerable to path traversal server receive a zip file with something like ../../../../../../../tmp/hack.sh, the file will be saved in /tmp/hack.sh instead of /tmp/zip/hack.sh
